# About

Folks in the Apple developer community are always sharing great Xcode tips &mdash; usually via Twitter or blog posts. Wouldn't it be nice if we collected them all in a single place to share? The goal of this project is to host all of these Xcode tips in a single place, and make it [easy for anyone to contribute](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/xcode-tips.github.io/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
