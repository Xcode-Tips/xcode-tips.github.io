# About

Folks in the Apple developer community are always sharing great Xcode tips &mdash; usually via Twitter or blog posts. Wouldn't it be nice if we collected them all in a single place to share? The goal of this project is to host all of these Xcode tips in a single place, and make it [easy for anyone to contribute](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/xcode-tips.github.io/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# [Breakpoints](#breakpoints)

### Use breakpoints as "bookmarks"

> Any time I am exploring or getting familiar with a new codebase in Xcode, especially very large projects, I use disabled breakpoints as ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù to keep track of where I am, where I have been, and things I want to remember or need to revisit. Sometimes I even do this when debugging issues in codebases that I know well.

### Quickly toggling breakpoints

Use `Cmd+\` to toggle a breakpoint on the current line.

### Generating class initializers

Xcode can generate class initializers. Select your class name, then go to the Editor menu and choose Refactor > Generate Memberwise Initializer.

### Selecting blocks of code

You can double click a brace to select the entire block of code it contains.

# [Debugging](#debugging)

### `NSDoubleLocalizedStrings` and Friends

> The `NSDoubleLocalizedStrings` user default is a reasonably well-known and officially documented localization debugging aide. It repeats the text of each localized string, making it double-length so that you can test whether your layout still works.
>
> Another longstanding one is `NSShowNonLocalizedStrings`, which logs to Console when a string can‚Äôt be found.
>
> Interface Builder also lets you preview views using an ‚ÄúAccented Pseudolanguage‚Äù and a ‚ÄúBounded String Pseudolanguage.‚Äù These correspond to the `NSAccentuateLocalizedStrings` and `NSSurroundLocalizedStrings` user defaults.
>
> Finally, there are `NSForceRightToLeftLocalizedStrings` and `AppleTextDirection` to enable the ‚ÄúRight to Left Pseudolanguage.‚Äù This lets you use test right-to-left layout (e.g. for Arabic) using strings from your development language.

# [Crashes](#crashes)

### Viewing .crash files

In Xcode‚Äôs Organizer, in the Crashes section, you can right-click or ctrl-click on any row and choose Show in Finder. This will reveal a .crashpoint file ‚Äî do a Show Package Contents and then dig in further. You will find .crash files with the full crash logs, which provide a lot more info than what you see in Organizer.

# [Refactoring](#refactoring)

### Faster Xcode Rename Refactoring

If you use the rename refactoring in Xcode a lot, you can save some time by skipping the code folding animation:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode CodeFoldingAnimationSpeed -int 0
```

# [Search](#search)

### Deleting search results

When you search using Xcode‚Äôs find navigator, you can click on individual results and tap Backspace to remove them.

# [Settings](#settings)

### Customizing the file header comment and other text macros

Xcode allows you to customize the file header and other so-called text macros using a plist file. 

1. Create a property list file named `IDETemplateMacros.plist`.
2. For every text macro you want to customize, add a new key to the plist‚Äôs dictionary.
3. Copy the file to one of the following locations.
    1. `<ProjectName>.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist`
    2. `<WorkspaceName>.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist`
    3. ...

### Improving the assistant editor

1. Set ‚ÄúUses Focused Editor‚Äù in the Navigation preferences
1. `cmd-J` to switch between panes or open new ones
1. `cmd-shift-O` to open files in the currently focused pane

### Using behaviors to improve debugging

> In Xcode‚Äôs preferences, go to the Behaviors tab. Navigate to the ‚ÄòRunning‚Äô section and click ‚ÄòPauses‚Äô. Here you can instruct Xcode to open a new tab by checking the box for ‚ÄòShow tab named‚Äô and giving it a name. By default, showing the ‚ÄòDebug Navigator‚Äô should be enabled. Next, I like to show the debugger with the ‚ÄòVariables & Console View‚Äô, as well as hide the Utilities sidebar on the right.

# [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)

### Jump to a specific line

Open the file you want. Press `Cmd+L`, type a line number and Xcode will jump directly to that line.

### Reindenting/Formatting code

Press `Ctrl+I` to apply Xcode's indentation and formatting.

### Adding comments quickly

Use `Cmd+/` to toggle comments for the current line or selection. Use `Option+Cmd+/`, pressed directly before a method to have Xcode generate a documentation comment.

###  Remapping unhelpful keys

Some great shortcuts (e.g. `Shift+Cmd+O` for Open Quickly) are next to useless shortcuts (`Shift+Cmd+P`, for the never times you want to print code.) It takes only seconds to remove unhelpful keys, and you can even remap things like `Cmd+P` to resuming SwiftUI's preview.

# [Simulator](#simulator)

### Tiling the simulator

If you frequently move from Xcode to the simulator, tile them side by side. With the simulator active, go to the Window menu and choose Tile Window To Right Of Screen, then select Xcode on the left. You can adjust the split so the simulator sits snugly on the right.

### Status bars

Clean up and configure Simulator status bars using `simctl status_bar`, automate using [Nine41](https://github.com/jessesquires/Nine41).

# [Testing](#testing)

### Re-run your last test

Use `Ctrl+Opt+Cmd+G` to re-run your last test. [Jon Reid](https://twitter.com/qcoding) has a name for this making it easier to remember: ‚Äúsmash go!‚Äù

Source: [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/229/24-quick-xcode-tips)

### Randomizing test order

Go to the Product menu, hold down Option, then click Test. Inside the Info tab, click Options then check Randomize Execution Order to run tests in a different order every time.

Source: [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/229/24-quick-xcode-tips)

### Improving UI test reliability

You can disable or speed-up animations, and increase timeouts for `waitForExistence()`.

Source: [Jesse Squires](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2021/03/17/xcode-ui-testing-reliability-tips/)

### Testing in-app purchases

Make a new StoreKit Config File, and add your IAP. Now go to the Product menu, hold down Option, and click Run. From the Options tab of the window, change StoreKit Config, and now you'll use the test IAP.

# [Usability](#usability)

### Expanding autocomplete

You can grab the edge of the autocomplete popup and drag it as wide as you want!

### Generating an interface file

Press `Ctrl+Cmd+Up` to display a generated interface, showing properties, function signatures, and comments for a type. Press it again, to jump to tests for that file if they exist.

Source: [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/229/24-quick-xcode-tips)

# [User Defaults](#user-defaults)

### Make Xcode's Assistant aware of your ViewModels, Views, etc:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEAdditionalCounterpartSuffixes -array-add "ViewModel" "View" "Screen"
```

You can check the current value of this default using `defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEAdditionalCounterpartSuffixes`.

Source: [Peter Friese](https://twitter.com/peterfriese/status/1364544309878534144)

### Prevent restoring the last open project

This is useful if you have a project that crashes Xcode on launch, if you want to run multiple Xcode versions for different projects, or if you always want to choose the project to open.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ApplePersistenceIgnoreState -bool YES
```

# [Xcode-select](#xcode-select)

### Quickly switching between Xcodes

> Using plain xcode-select is slow because you have to provide the path to the Xcode you want to select each time. I wrote a custom shell command to switch between Xcodes more quickly.
