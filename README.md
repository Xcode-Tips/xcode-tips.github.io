# About

Folks in the Apple developer community are always sharing great Xcode tips &mdash; usually via Twitter or blog posts. Wouldn't it be nice if we collected them all in a single place to share? The goal of this project is to host all of these Xcode tips in a single place, and make it [easy for anyone to contribute](https://github.com/Xcode-Tips/xcode-tips.github.io/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# [Breakpoints](#breakpoints)

### Use breakpoints as "bookmarks"

> Any time I am exploring or getting familiar with a new codebase in Xcode, especially very large projects, I use disabled breakpoints as ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù to keep track of where I am, where I have been, and things I want to remember or need to revisit. Sometimes I even do this when debugging issues in codebases that I know well.

### Quickly toggling breakpoints

Use `Cmd+\` to toggle a breakpoint on the current line.

### Play sound files in breakpoints

> Audible Xcode breakpoints allow a sound effect to be played while continuing the executable without interruptions. This can be a really useful debugging tool. Custom Xcode breakpoint sound files can be found on GitHub at [Xcode Breakpoint Sounds](https://github.com/matthewreagan/Xcode-Breakpoint-Sounds).

# [Build Times](#build-times)

### Fix slow codesigning

> Poking around, I came across this [thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/66418). While I didn‚Äôt have the main problem described there of duplicate certificates, buried in that thread was the following advice: trim `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist`
>
> Opening that file up revealed that I had several entries, all except one pointing to non-existent files with the one valid entry pointing to my login keychain. After removing the invalid entries, code signing only took up to 1 second, max. This shaved 40-60 seconds off of my full release builds and 10 seconds off of incremental ones. Huge savings.

### Copying framework headers

> Another thing I noticed in the cleanup was that some of my frameworks were being copied without their headers.
> [...]
> Apparently, there‚Äôs a hidden setting in your `project.pbxproj` file for copying frameworks where you can specify whether headers get copied over.

The only way to enable/disable this is to edit the `project.pbxproj` by hand. The flag in question is `RemoveHeadersOnCopy`.

# [Debugging](#debugging)

### `NSDoubleLocalizedStrings` and Friends

> The `NSDoubleLocalizedStrings` user default is a reasonably well-known and officially documented localization debugging aide. It repeats the text of each localized string, making it double-length so that you can test whether your layout still works.
>
> Another longstanding one is `NSShowNonLocalizedStrings`, which logs to Console when a string can‚Äôt be found.
>
> Interface Builder also lets you preview views using an ‚ÄúAccented Pseudolanguage‚Äù and a ‚ÄúBounded String Pseudolanguage.‚Äù These correspond to the `NSAccentuateLocalizedStrings` and `NSSurroundLocalizedStrings` user defaults.
>
> Finally, there are `NSForceRightToLeftLocalizedStrings` and `AppleTextDirection` to enable the ‚ÄúRight to Left Pseudolanguage.‚Äù This lets you use test right-to-left layout (e.g. for Arabic) using strings from your development language.

# [Crashes](#crashes)

### Viewing .crash files

In Xcode‚Äôs Organizer, in the Crashes section, you can right-click or ctrl-click on any row and choose Show in Finder. This will reveal a .crashpoint file ‚Äî do a Show Package Contents and then dig in further. You will find .crash files with the full crash logs, which provide a lot more info than what you see in Organizer.

# [Refactoring](#refactoring)

### Faster Xcode Rename Refactoring

If you use the rename refactoring in Xcode a lot, you can save some time by skipping the code folding animation:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode CodeFoldingAnimationSpeed -int 0
```

### Customizing the file header comment and other text macros

Xcode allows you to customize the file header and other so-called text macros using a plist file. 

1. Create a property list file named `IDETemplateMacros.plist`.
2. For every text macro you want to customize, add a new key to the plist‚Äôs dictionary.
3. Copy the file to one of the following locations.
    1. `<Name>.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/`
    2. `<Name>.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/`
    3. ...

### Improving the assistant editor

1. Set ‚ÄúUses Focused Editor‚Äù in the Navigation preferences
1. `cmd-J` to switch between panes or open new ones
1. `cmd-shift-O` to open files in the currently focused pane

### Using behaviors to improve debugging

> In Xcode‚Äôs preferences, go to the Behaviors tab. Navigate to the ‚ÄòRunning‚Äô section and click ‚ÄòPauses‚Äô. Here you can instruct Xcode to open a new tab by checking the box for ‚ÄòShow tab named‚Äô and giving it a name. By default, showing the ‚ÄòDebug Navigator‚Äô should be enabled. Next, I like to show the debugger with the ‚ÄòVariables & Console View‚Äô, as well as hide the Utilities sidebar on the right.

# [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)

### Jump to a specific line

Open the file you want. Press `Cmd+L`, type a line number and Xcode will jump directly to that line.

### Reindenting/Formatting code

Press `Ctrl+I` to apply Xcode's indentation and formatting.

### Adding comments quickly

Use `Cmd+/` to toggle comments for the current line or selection. Use `Option+Cmd+/`, pressed directly before a method to have Xcode generate a documentation comment.

###  Remapping unhelpful keys

Some great shortcuts (e.g. `Shift+Cmd+O` for Open Quickly) are next to useless shortcuts (`Shift+Cmd+P`, for the never times you want to print code.) It takes only seconds to remove unhelpful keys, and you can even remap things like `Cmd+P` to resuming SwiftUI's preview.

Source: [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/229/24-quick-xcode-tips)

###  Increase or reducing  the font size
 
 Press `Cmd+'+'` for increasing the font size of the source code and press `Cmd+'-'` for reducing the font size.
 
 ###  Move cursor to the top or bottom of the file
 
 Press `Cmd+Up Arrow` to move to the top of the file. `Cmd+ Down Arrow` will take you to the bottom of the file.
 
 ###  Open and close Xcode debug area
 
 Press `Cmd+Shift+Y` to open and close the debug area.
 
 ###  Switch between multiple Xcode Projects
 
 Press `Cmd+~` to switch between multiple Xcode projects.

# [Simulator](#simulator)

### Tiling the simulator

If you frequently move from Xcode to the simulator, tile them side by side. With the simulator active, go to the Window menu and choose Tile Window To Right Of Screen, then select Xcode on the left. You can adjust the split so the simulator sits snugly on the right.

# [User Defaults](#user-defaults)

### Make Xcode's Assistant aware of your ViewModels, Views, etc

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEAdditionalCounterpartSuffixes -array-add "ViewModel" "View" "Screen"
```

You can check the current value of this default using `defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEAdditionalCounterpartSuffixes`.

### Prevent restoring the last open project

This is useful if you have a project that crashes Xcode on launch, if you want to run multiple Xcode versions for different projects, or if you always want to choose the project to open.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ApplePersistenceIgnoreState -bool YES
```

### Show project build times in the activity viewer

This shows the build time duration directly in the activity viewer every time you build.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES
```

# [Xcode Versions](#xcode-versions)

### Quickly switching between Xcodes

> Using plain xcode-select is slow because you have to provide the path to the Xcode you want to select each time. I wrote a custom shell command to switch between Xcodes more quickly.
