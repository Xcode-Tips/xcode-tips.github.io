# Crashes

### Viewing .crash files

In Xcode’s Organizer, in the Crashes section, you can right-click or ctrl-click on any row and choose Show in Finder. This will reveal a `.crashpoint` file — do a "Show Package Contents" and then dig in further. You will find `.crash` files with the full crash logs, which provide a lot more info than what you see in Organizer.
