Pull requests are welcome! We only ask that you follow these steps:

1. If adding a new tip, be sure it is specific to using Xcode, not a general coding tip.
2. Conform to the existing pattern for listing a tip.
    1. Place it under the correct category.
    2. Give it a brief but descriptive heading.
    3. Provide a concise explanation.
        1. keyboard shortcuts should be **bold** and should not contain symbol names like `cmd`, `shift`, etc. Instead refer to [this table](#Quick-reference-for-Apple-symbol-glyphs) to get the HTML code needed for rendering the glyph of the desired keyboard symbol.
    4. Link to the original source (a blog post, a tweet, etc.), if any, to give credit to the person who shared it. 
    5. If there isn't a post or a tweet, and it is just a tip you want to share, credit yourself! ðŸ˜„
